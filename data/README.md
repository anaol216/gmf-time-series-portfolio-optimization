# Data

This directory contains all the raw and processed data used in the project.

### Structure

The data directory is organized into two main subdirectories:

* **`raw`**: This folder stores the raw, un-processed CSV files downloaded directly from Yahoo Finance for each ticker. These files serve as the original source data for the project.
    * **Contents:** `TSLA.csv`, `SPY.csv`, `BND.csv`, etc.
    
* **`processed`**: This folder stores the cleaned and transformed data that is ready for analysis and modeling. The files in this directory are generated by the preprocessing steps.
    * **Contents:**
        * `merged_prices.csv`: Contains the daily "Adj Close" prices for all tickers, aligned by date. This file is the primary input for the analysis and modeling tasks.
        * `daily_returns.csv`: Contains the daily percentage returns for all tickers, calculated from the `merged_prices.csv` file.

### Usage

* The Python scripts (`src/preprocess.py`) will automatically download raw data and save the processed files into the `processed` folder.
* You should not manually edit the files in the `processed` directory.
* The notebooks (`preprocess_and_eda.ipynb`, `forecast_tsla.ipynb`) are designed to read the necessary data from this `processed` folder.
